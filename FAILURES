- cc a non existing C file gives bogus error - need to check cc68 return
  codes and stuff
- overlong names clashing in assembler should be caught in the compiler name
  compare - and we probably want to change the format a bit to allow longer
  names 8(
- linker does not always spot segments overlapping one another or wrapping
  (eg try 32 bytes in a segment at $FFF8)


Optimizing Rules
----------------

Lots of easy wins on 8bit - eg spotting

CLRA
ANDB #n
STAA @tmp
ORAB @tmp
JSR bool*

and on static long = int (spot the clear sreg, and copy of sreg and just clear
in target)

and tons more

Libc test compiling
-------------------

None at code generation

Linker
------

Sometimes a ZP asm reference to a non existing variable ends up as U 0 in
the map and we didn't error
