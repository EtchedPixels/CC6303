6502 support

Minimally tested at this point as 6502 Fuzix is really only base level.

Suports the full 6502 instruction set. The syntax is fairly conventional but
might benefit from a few synonyms.

Addresses are assumed to be zp relative when a constant whose value is < 256
and the instruction has a zp form, otherwise absolute.

A symbol can be forced to be a type by defining it within that segment thus

	.ZP
fred	.equ	32

creates a ZP based definition

	.ABSOLUTE
fred	.equ	32

creates an absolute constant (non-relocating)

	.CODE

fred	.equ	32

creates a 16bit relocatable symbol relative to code space.

All the magic conversions assume ZP is 0.

To Add
======

2A03
65C02
65CE02

maybe 65C816

The ability to specify where ZP is (and we need somewhere to tag that in the
object file format and linker!)

The ability to refuse to do ZP co-oercions for 65c816

Syntax for high byte/low byte of ( <$xx >$xx )
